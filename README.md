Play the classic logic problem in the terminal.

This is a project I did to learn the basics of Rust.
The Monty Hall problem is a logic problem. Should the player switch their selection or not? See below for more details.

To play, open a terminal in the root folder, build and run the project (cargo run).

You will be presented with three "doors." There is a prize behind one.
You to pick one door.
At least one of the other two must be empty (non-prize).
The game randomly opens one non-prize door.
You will be prompted to either keep your selection or choose the other non-opened door.
The game will show final results.

So is it wise to switch doors or keep your selection? Or is it 50/50?
